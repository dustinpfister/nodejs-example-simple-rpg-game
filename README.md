# nodejs-example-simple-rpg-game

This is a nodejs example of a simple RPG style game that can be played in the command line. All I wanted to make is a simple game that involves an \@ symbol as the player, and E chars for enemies in a fixed grid area composed of just characters in the standard output. I want each move to result in the state of the game being saved to a json file in the current working director and that is it.
